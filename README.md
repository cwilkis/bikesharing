## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to analyze data from an existing bike share company in NYC to determine if it can be replicated in Des Moines, IA. The client requested easy to digest visulization, so Tableau was used to show key metrics.

## Results
Of the close to 2.4 million users in NYC, close to 75% were men. Over 75% of all users were also subscribers.

Peak Riding Hours tended to be right before work (7-9am) or righ after work (5-7pm) and again were overwhelmingly men

Starting and Ending Locations were very similar based on the two heat maps below.

## Summary
Based on the visual analysis, the primary users are not related to tourism, rather commuter based as an alternative to cars, walking, and the subway. The overwhelming majority of users are men. Women make up less than 25% of all riders. 

The original question was is this scaleable to Des Moines. Ia. The short anwswer is, maybe. According to United States Census Bureau, the population of Des Moines in 2020 was 215,408. That is 2.5% the size of NYC, with 8.38 million population in 2020. NYC is also an extremely walking/commuter friendly city, due to it's small area compared to its population density. I believe additional analysis and visualizations are needed on the following in order to determin if Citibike should expand to Des Moines. 

- Rides/month on repeat customers
- Age of average rider in NYC compared to average inhabitant age
- Weather comparison between the two cities.
